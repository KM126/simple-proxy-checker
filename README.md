i dont think any explaining is needed for this tool , so basic..


the tools needs http/net ruby gems to run so make sure to install them :

$ sudo gem install http && sudo gem install net

to install this tool simply clone the repo and execute the r.rb file : 

$ git clone https://github.com/KM126/simple-proxy-checker

$ sudo ruby r.rb 

note : if you encounter any problems with proxies path put them on the same directory the tool is in
